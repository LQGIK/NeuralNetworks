<h1>Hello! This is my first shaky success with facial recognition</h1>
<h2> Context: </h2>
<p> I utilized around 90 images of myself and 50 images of my sister to preprocess and train my FeedForward Convolutional Neural
Network Model. When I trained it on 50 epochs, it had around an 80% success rate. I'm going to attempt to train it on the rest of my
family members. Anyone is welcome to use my model but instead give it access to a directory of their own photos.</p>

<li> Holding 'q' will exit the program </li>
